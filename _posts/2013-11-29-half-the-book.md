title: Half the book (I used to be)
---

I take a trip down to Half Price Books on Shattuck and Addison every Sunday [1].
They're open an astonishing 8a-11p every day, which is basically better than
the average Chinese restaurant in the Bay Area.

Half Price Books, if you haven't ever been in one, is mostly a rip-off. They
may or may not have the book you're looking for, but if they do they'll definitely
sell it to you for more than Amazon would. The main thing that draws me
there with such predictability is its
amazingly disappointing Clearance section, whose job is to make you feel bad
for buying *The Carnal Prayer Mat* [2] a month ago for $25 dollars on Amazon for your class when
ha ha we have it here for $2. The Clearance section also serves as the black
hole in the back of the store where books such as *The Da Vinci Code* [3] and
*The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo*, after being purchased for $20 at Costco and
subsequently thoroughly disappointing their owners, go to be peddled away
for anywhere between 1 and 3 dollars. There's also the spinny racks (wheee) [4] scattered
across the store, filled with wonderful and terrible $1 books. I occasionally
manage to score a bargain classic or a popular foreign book at the cost of
thumbing through an infinite maze of romance novels(, their turgid, swollen chapters tempting the savvy
bargain hunter to stray from her quest to strike $1 gold). (Here we should ask
ourselves, 'Is $1 worth of gold
more valuable than $1 worth of Danielle Steele?' And the answer is maybe,
because you haven't seen some of the books Clearance shits.) But most of the
time I end up with something obscure that I can't read on my commute lest
some curious book-lover asks me questions about it. Yes, I'm ashamed.

In any case, one Sunday I found myself wandering into Diet. It
was a friend's birthday and I was willing to make the $5 sacrifice to buy a real
Half-Priced Book. For a second, I was nearly blinded by the white of this section. In my
dear home Clearance, every resident has on its cover the yellow luster
of very old teeth (or a rotting dandelion). Curious and completely out of my
element, I peeked next door at Gardening, then at Art and
Photography.

Of course, I took some pictures. Guess what each of these bougie sections are:

<img src="/images/hpb-art.jpg" width="400">
<img src="/images/hpb-gardening.jpg" width="400">
<img src="/images/hpb-religion.jpg" width="400">
<img src="/images/hpb-anthropology.jpg" width="400">
<img src="/images/hpb-diet.jpg" width="400">

I can't really contrive any prose here about how art is mainly black
and sex and religion are red and dieting is white and
gardening is green and it's all because we're all living in some cognitive illusion
and then come to the conclusion that bestsellers should all be blue. But someone
probably can. I just think this is pretty cool to look at for a few seconds, which was
what I did at the time (modulo taking pictures).

I'm actually ridiculously scared of taking pictures in public, because my worst
nightmare is ending up on someone's 'Asian girls taking pictures of X' Tumblr,
so I ran right back to Clearance after this. Maybe I'll dump a timeline of my
Clearance findings in a later post.
